## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Set Up Spotify API Access

1. **Create a Spotify App:**
   - Go to [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
   - Click "Create app"
   - Fill in app details (name and description)
   - Add redirect URI: `http://localhost:8888/callback`
   - Save your app

2. **Get Your Credentials:**
   - Copy your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from the app dashboard

### 3. Configure Credentials

Create a `secrets.py` file in the project directory:

```python
# Spotify API Credentials
CLIENT_ID = "your_client_id_here"
CLIENT_SECRET = "your_client_secret_here"
REDIRECT_URI = "http://localhost:8888/callback"
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** Never commit `secrets.py` to version control! It's already in `.gitignore`.

### 4. Run the Analysis

#### Option A: Analyze a Specific Playlist
```bash
# Interactive mode - you'll be prompted for playlist name
python spotify_playlist_extractor.py

# Command line mode - specify playlist name directly
python spotify_playlist_extractor.py "My Awesome Playlist"
python spotify_playlist_extractor.py "Glastonbury 2025 Wishlist"
```

#### Option B: Analyze All Your Playlists
```bash
# Extract artists from all your playlists
python all_playlists_extractor.py
```

#### Option C: Find Glastonbury Matches
```bash
# First, extract all playlist data
python all_playlists_extractor.py

# Then find matches with Glastonbury 2025 lineup
python all_playlists_matcher.py
```

## üé™ Glastonbury 2025 Analysis

This toolkit includes the complete Glastonbury 2025 lineup with stage and timing information. The matcher will:

1. **Find exact matches** between your playlist artists and the festival lineup
2. **Show stage and timing details** for each matched artist
3. **Create a personalized schedule** (`all_playlists_glastonbury_schedule.txt`)
4. **Organize by day and time** for easy festival planning

### Example Glastonbury Output
```
=== GLASTONBURY 2025 - ALL PLAYLISTS MATCHER ===

Checked 15 playlists against Glastonbury 2025
Found 23 total exact matches!

=== MY SUMMER HITS (5 matches) ===
* Dua Lipa -> Dua Lipa
   Pyramid Stage - Friday 27 June at 21:30 - 23:00

* Arctic Monkeys -> Arctic Monkeys  
   Pyramid Stage - Saturday 28 June at 21:30 - 23:00
```

## üîê First-Time Authentication

The first time you run the script:

1. **Browser will open** - Spotify login page
2. **Log in** with your Spotify account
3. **Authorize the app** - click "Agree" to grant permissions
4. **Copy the redirect URL** - even if you see a connection error, copy the full URL from your browser
5. **Paste into terminal** - the script will extract the authorization code

After this one-time setup, the script will work automatically using cached credentials.

## üìÅ Output Files

### Single Playlist Analysis
For a playlist called "My Summer Hits":
- `My_Summer_Hits_artists.json` - Complete data including artist IDs, track names, frequency counts
- `My_Summer_Hits_artists_list.txt` - Simple text list of all unique artists

### All Playlists Analysis
- `all_playlists_artists.json` - Complete data for all your playlists with artist counts and statistics

### Glastonbury Analysis
- `all_playlists_glastonbury_schedule.txt` - Your personalized festival schedule organized by day and time
- Console output showing matches by playlist with stage and timing details

## üí° Use Cases

- **Festival Preparation:** Create your personalized Glastonbury schedule based on your music taste
- **Playlist Discovery:** Find which artists you listen to most across all playlists
- **Music Analysis:** Discover patterns in your listening habits
- **Concert Planning:** Get organized lists of artists for other festival planning
- **Friend Comparisons:** Share your festival schedule with friends attending Glastonbury

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### "Invalid Client" Error
- Check that your `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` are correct in `secrets.py`
- Ensure no extra spaces or quotes in the credentials

### "Invalid Redirect URI" Error
- Make sure your Spotify app has exactly this redirect URI: `http://localhost:8888/callback`
- URI must match exactly (including port and path)

### "Playlist Not Found" Error
- Check the exact spelling of your playlist name
- The script will show all available playlists if the target isn't found
- Playlist names are case-insensitive

### Connection Error After Authorization
- This is normal! The browser shows an error, but the script still works
- Just copy the full URL from your browser address bar and paste it into the terminal
